## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Learning to reference figures
```{r FigreAssessmment2,fig.cap="This is random noise"}
library(tidyverse)
x = seq(1:100) 
y = rnorm(100) 
dat = data.frame(x, y) 
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
    geom_line()
```
See above figures from (Figure:\@ref(fig:FigreAssessmment2))

##Learning to reference tables
```{r chunk2}
dat %>% head(5)%>%
  knitr::kable(caption="rawdata")
```
See above table from (Table:\@ref(tab:chunk2))
